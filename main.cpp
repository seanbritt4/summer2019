\mainpage Multiple Lights

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

This example uses several light sources.  The GraphicsEngine.cpp file
has several commented lines of code that will allow the user to quickly make
updates to the scene and the properties of the materials and light.

\subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- F11 or O: Turns on the spherical camera.
- F12 or P: Turns on the yaw-pitch-roll camera.

If the spherical camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the camera's theta value.
- Right: Decreases the camera's theta value.
- Up: Increases the camera's psi value.
- Down: Decreases the camera's psi value.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Up: Decreases the camera's radius.
- Down: Increases the camera's radius.

If the yaw-pitch-roll camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the yaw.
- Right: Decreases the yaw.
- Up: Increases the pitch.
- Down: Decreases the pitch.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Left: Increases the roll.
- Right: Decreases the roll.
- Up: Moves the camera forward.
- Down: Moves the camera backward.

If the shift or S key is down:

- Left: Moves the camera left.
- Right: Moves the camera right.
- Up: Moves the camera up.
- Down: Moves the camera down.

If the Alt or X key is down then the arrow keys control the light,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the light's theta value.
- Right: Decreases the light's theta value.
- Up: Increases the light's psi value.
- Down: Decreases the light's psi value.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Up: Decreases the light's radius.
- Down: Increases the light's radius.

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse
button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression
of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\note Note that the shader programs "VertexShaderLighting.glsl" and "PhongOneLight.glsl"
are expected to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be
able to support OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
